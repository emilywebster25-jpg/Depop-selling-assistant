---

## üöÄ How to Use the Enhanced System

### Run the Enhanced Analyzer
```bash
cd /Users/emilywebster/Dev/Depop_Selling
python3 photo_grouper.py
```

### Interactive Grouping Process

#### 1. **Photo Display**
- Shows you **10 photos at a time** with details:
  - Filename, dimensions, file size
  - Date modified (helps identify related photos)
  - Quality score (helps pick the best ones)

#### 2. **Grouping Interface**
```
OPTIONS:
  1-10: Add photo to current group
  'done': Finish current group and save item
  'skip': Skip current photo
  'restart': Start current group over  
  'quit': Exit grouping
```

#### 3. **Smart Photo Selection**
- **Quality scoring**: Ranks photos by resolution, aspect ratio, file size
- **Automatic recommendations**: Suggests best 4 photos per item
- **Manual override**: You can choose different photos if you prefer

#### 4. **Item Details Input**
For each group, you'll enter:
- Brand, category, item type
- Size, color, condition
- Purchase price, target price
- Material, notes

#### 5. **Automatic Processing**
- **Photos renamed**: `brand_color_itemtype_1.jpg` through `_4.jpg`
- **Organized by category**: Moved to correct folders
- **Inventory updated**: Single entry per item with all 4 photos
- **Hashtags generated**: Based on category and trends

## üí° Tips for Efficient Grouping

### Identify Related Photos
Look for photos taken at similar times (check date modified) or with similar backgrounds/lighting.

### Typical Photo Groups
- **Front view** (main listing photo)
- **Back view** (show full garment)
- **Detail shot** (fabric, buttons, tags)
- **Styling shot** (how to wear it)

### Quality Selection
The system will suggest the best photos based on:
- **Resolution** (higher is better)
- **Square aspect ratio** (required for Depop)
- **File size** (not too large, not too small)
- **Filename hints** (front, main, detail, etc.)

## ‚ö° Pro Tips

### Speed Up the Process
- **Group chronologically**: Photos taken at the same time are likely the same item
- **Look for backgrounds**: Same background/lighting = probably same item
- **Use quality scores**: Let the system recommend the best photos
- **Don't overthink**: 3-4 good photos per item is perfect

### Handle Difficult Cases
- **Similar items**: If you have multiple black tops, be extra careful with grouping
- **Mixed lighting**: Photos with different lighting might still be the same item
- **Unclear photos**: Use the 'skip' option for photos that are too blurry/dark

### Batch Strategy
- **Process 20-30 items at a time**: Take breaks to stay focused
- **Save frequently**: The system saves each completed group immediately
- **Review after**: Check your inventory_tracker.csv to see results
